Hi! My name is Farane /færʌne/. I am working on improving neural language models in the [Databases and Information Systems](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems) group at <b>Max Planck Institute for Informatics</b>, Saarbrücken, Germany.
I got my M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from <b>Sharif University of Technology</b>, Tehran, Iran. My research focused on multilingual and low-resource NLP and my master's thesis was about Persian named entity recognition (NER) using transfer learning and active learning. You can find my master's thesis abstract [here](http://FaraneJalaliFarahani.github.io/files/abstract.pdf).
