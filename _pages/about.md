Hi! My name is Farane /færʌne/. I am working on improving neural language models in the [Databases and Information Systems](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems) group at Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany.
I got my M.Sc. degree in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. My research focused on named entity recognition using transfer learning and active learning. You can find my master's thesis abstract [here](http://FaraneJalaliFarahani.github.io/files/abstract.pdf)
