Hi! My name is Farane /færʌne/. I am a research and teaching assistant working on Computational Social Science at the University of Stuttgart, [Institute for AI](https://www.ki.uni-stuttgart.de/). Previously, I interned at the [Databases and Information Systems](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems) group at Max Planck Institute for Informatics on improving neural language models for information extraction. I got my M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence from  [Department of Computer Engineering](http://ce.sharif.ir/), Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. My research focused on multilingual and low-resource NLP and my master's thesis was about Persian Named Entity Recognition (NER) using transfer learning and active learning.
