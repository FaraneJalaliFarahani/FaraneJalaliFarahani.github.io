Hi! My name is Farane /færʌne/. I am working on improving neural language models in the [Databases and Information Systems](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems) group at Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Saarbrücken, Germany.
I obtained a master of science degree in computer engineering from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. My research focused on Persian named entity recognition using transfer learning and active learning.
